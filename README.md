Problems I've solved from Universidad de Valladolid marathon 
problemset (http://uva.onlinejudge.org/) with the sole objective to train
my problem solving and algorithm skills.

Each directory correpond to a problem, where the directory name is the problem ID.
Normally, I implement using C or Java. C implementations have a file called 'tst',
with some test cases and Java implementations have jUnits tests and an input file.
